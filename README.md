# SourceCoop Mods

This repository contains two mods for SourceCoop, allowing you to play Black Mesa in cooperative mode.

1. **xen_hevsuit:**
   - This mod detects the non-functional charging crystals for the HEV suit through entity queries and starts charging the HEV suit.

2. **map_preservation:**
   - This mod saves the last played map of the server in a file and loads this map again upon a new server start. This allows you to automatically continue playing from the map start point where you previously left off.
